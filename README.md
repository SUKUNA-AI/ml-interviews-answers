# ML Interviews Answers 📘✨

Hi 👋 Welcome to **ML Interviews Answers** - my project where I collect answers to questions from the book [ML Interviews](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) by Chip Huyen. This book is a must-have for preparing for machine learning interviews, and I'm sharing my solutions to help myself and others. 💡

## About the project 🌟

We start with **Chapter 5** - “Algorithms and Data Structures”. Why this chapter? It's a fundamental part that collects questions that are often asked in interviews (complexity of algorithms, trees, graphs, etc.). Great starting point for preparation! 🚀 I will gradually add answers to questions from other chapters - stay tuned! 😊

## Structure of the repository 🗂️

Each chapter is a separate folder. Inside there may be subchapters with question answer files (e.g. `question1.md`). Example structure:  
- **[Chapter 5: Algorithms and Data Structures](chapter5/)**  
  - [Subchapter 5.1: Complexity of Algorithms](chapter5/subchapter5.1/)  
  - [Subchapter 5.2: Data Structures](chapter5/subchapter5.2/)  
- **[Chapter 6: Practical Tips](chapter6/)**  
- ...and so on

## Sample answer 💬

**Question**: What is a hash table?  
**Answer**: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast access (O(1) on average) thanks to a hash function.  
Issues:  
- Collisions (solved by chaining or open addressing).  
Applications:  
- Caching, dictionaries, fast search.
